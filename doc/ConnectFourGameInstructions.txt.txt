Intro

In the game Connect Four, players select a color and then alternately drop colored tokens into a vertically hanging grid consisting of six rows and seven columns. The fragments land in the lowest area of the column, falling straight down. Being the first player to line up four of their own tokens in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal fashion is the aim of the game. The game Connect Four can be solved. Making the proper moves allows the first player to win every time.
